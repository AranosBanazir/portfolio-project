## Description

This website is a place to direct future employers to see a few of my better projects that are currently deployed. It is a simple but complete page with visual links to both the deployed sites as well as the repositiories for each projects. Links to my social's as well as ways to contact me, and a short blurb about who I am are included in the site. The hope is that having the projects I have worked on in one consice place as well as having some information about myself will make it easier for potential employers to be able to see what I am capable of as well as get to know me.


## Installation

No instillation is required.

## Usage
Usage of the site is fairly self-explanitory. Using the navigation buttons in the header, you can scroll to specific areas of the page. By hovering the images you are given the option to view either the deployed site, or the repository for the project. Alternitively, you can click on the images themselves and be directed to the deployed project. If you fill out the form in the contact section with your information, then I can get back to you in response to your comments. I can be reached at any of the listed forms of communication as well.
